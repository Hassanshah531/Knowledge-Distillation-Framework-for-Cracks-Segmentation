At the core of this framework lies the Vector-Quantized Variational Teacher (VQ-VAE Teacher), a distinctive iteration of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE). The VQ-VAE Teacher serves as the guiding mentor, entrusted with the responsibility of instilling its vast domain expertise into a Multimodal Collaborative Student. The VQ-VAE Teacher is trained to extract discrete code representations, known as the “codebook,” for each image within the dataset, signifying a major leap in data comprehension and processing. The Multimodal Collaborative Student, aptly named for its ability to harmonize diverse data inputs, ingeniously amalgamates raw visual data with the codebook.
